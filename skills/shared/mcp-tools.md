# Snabbsite MCP reference

The MCP server is the **live-site** surface: it reads and edits a site that
already exists. The CLI's `site` namespace builds packages offline and never
touches a live site. Use this reference when a tool is denied, when you need to
know which tool exists, or before asking the human to widen a connection.

Endpoint: `https://snabbsite.com/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, OAuth via the
human's Snabbsite login). The human creates connections in the app under
AI-integrationer; you cannot mint one.

`https://snabbsite.com/auth.md` describes the whole connection story in one
fetchable file: the code-confirmation ceremony, both endpoints, and every scope
with a one-line description. A company with no website yet can be paired too,
and the grant then covers the company so you can create its first site.

## Scopes

`site:read` is always on — you cannot act blind. Everything else is granted per
connection, and the owner can untick anything at approval time.

| Scope | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| `site:read` | business, site, draft, published, brand, analytics |
| `content:write` | create/edit **draft** pages, sections, posts |
| `publish` | push the draft to the live snapshot |
| `ai:generate` | credit-spending generation (text + image) — **spends the owner's money** |
| `crm:read` | read leads, bookings, contacts — **real customer PII** |
| `crm:write` | update customer records/bookings (never deletion) |
| `settings:write` | business profile, brand, visitor assistant, search visibility |
| `domain:write` | connect/verify/select an existing domain (never purchase) |
| `access:write` | create/revoke website access |
| `communications:write` | send quotes, invoices, invites |
| `commerce:write` | invoices, offers, services, products |
| `workspace:write` | create a new site or a new company |

## Presets

The app offers presets rather than raw scopes. A new connection defaults to
**edit** — no publish, no spend, no PII.

| Preset | Scopes |
| --- | --- |
| view | `site:read` |
| **edit** (default) | `site:read`, `content:write` |
| publish | + `publish` |
| manage | `site:read`, `content:write`, `settings:write`, `crm:read`, `crm:write`, `commerce:write` |
| full | everything except `ai:generate` and `workspace:write` |

## Tool catalogue

### Read — `site:read`
`list_sites` · `get_site_overview` · `list_pages` · `get_page` ·
`list_draft_changes` · `get_brand` · `get_analytics_summary` ·
`get_section_json`*

Start every task with `list_sites` → `get_site_overview` → `list_pages` →
`get_page`. `list_draft_changes` before and after writing is how you separate
your changes from work that was already waiting.

### Draft edits — `content:write`
`update_section_text` (one content field by dot path, e.g. `headline`,
`items.0.title`) · `add_section` · `move_section` · `set_section_hidden` ·
`create_page` · `create_blog_post` · `update_page_seo` ·
`replace_section_content`* · `set_section_layout`* · `import_site` ·
`migrate_site_from_url`

Every one of these writes the DRAFT. The live site does not change.

**Before you reach for `import_site`, read the two ways in.** Neither is a
typed package:

> **Building in Next.js? Use the SDK. Their own code keeps drawing the page,
> and the owner edits only the fields they expose.**
> **Already have a website? Use the address or zip for best-effort visual
> capture. Text, images and links are editable. Captured layout stays fixed,
> and a typed rebuild is the fallback.**

So a human who writes the site themselves goes to the `make-site-editable`
skill, not to a tool here. A human who already has a website goes to
`migrate_site_from_url`, or to the app's own "Move your website" lane when
they hold a zip rather than an address. `import_site` lands a package, which is
a redesign on Snabbsite blocks, and it runs only when the human asks for a new
design in those words. `migrate_site_from_url` tries visual capture by default,
with no percentage guarantee. It can recreate common fades, scroll reveals
and smooth scrolling with Snabbsite code. Source JavaScript and custom
interactions do not move into the imported or published website.

\* `get_section_json`, `replace_section_content` and `set_section_layout`
additionally need the workspace's advanced-editor (Labs) grant and fail closed
without it. Treat a denial as "this is an ordinary workspace" and fall back to
`update_section_text`. When you do use them, pass the `rev` from
`get_section_json` as `clientRev` so a concurrent browser edit is rejected
instead of silently overwritten.

### Publishing — `publish`
`prepare_publish` · `prepare_unpublish` · `confirm_pending_action`

`publish_site` is **deprecated and always fails**. That is deliberate — see
[confirm-gated actions](#confirm-gated-actions).

### Settings — `settings:write`
`update_business_name` · `prepare_search_visibility`

### Commerce — `commerce:write`
`list_services` · `create_service` · `list_products` · `create_product` ·
`get_commerce_overview` · `prepare_publish_product`

### Customer data — `crm:read` / `crm:write`
`list_leads` · `list_bookings` · `list_contacts` (read) · `crm_update` (write)

Real people's data. Only touch these when the human asked for that specific
thing, never as background context-gathering.

### Domains — `domain:write`
`list_domains` (read is `site:read`) · `connect_domain` · `set_primary_domain`.
Connecting an existing domain only; no purchases over MCP.

### Access — `access:write`
`list_access` · `prepare_grant_access`

### Communications — `communications:write`
`list_sendable_documents` · `prepare_send_document`

### Generation — `ai:generate`
`generate_image` — spends the owner's credits. Ask first, every time.

### Workspace — `workspace:write`
`create_site` (unattended: a new draft is reversible) ·
`prepare_create_company` (confirm-gated: a company is a billing subject)

## Confirm-gated actions

Anything irreversible or outward-facing runs a two-step handshake:

```
prepare_*  →  the human approves the review card  →  confirm_pending_action
```

Gated: `prepare_publish`, `prepare_unpublish`, `prepare_search_visibility`,
`prepare_publish_product`, `prepare_send_document`, `prepare_grant_access`,
`prepare_create_company`.

`prepare_*` creates a review and changes nothing. `confirm_pending_action` is
redeemable **only from a press in the card** — you cannot call it to complete
your own plan. Do not look for a second route to the same effect; there isn't
one, and trying is the failure this design exists to catch.

A request to *edit* is never a request to publish. Publishing needs an explicit
ask in the current conversation ("publish", "gå live", "lägg ut det").

## Prompts

The server also ships guided prompts the human can invoke: `write_news_post`,
`prep_for_launch`, `seasonal_update`. They orient you first
(`get_site_overview`) and end by asking the human before anything is applied.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Missing the "<scope>" permission.` | the owner did not grant it | Name the refused tool and scope, and stop. Offer to let them widen it in AI-integrationer; never work around it. |
| Advanced tool denied but `update_section_text` works | no Labs/advanced-editor grant | Fall back to `update_section_text`. This is an ordinary workspace, not a bug. |
| `publish_site` fails | deprecated by design | Use `prepare_publish` and let the human approve. |
| A `prepare_*` result never completes | the human has not pressed approve | Tell them the approval is theirs to give. The action ref expires. |
| `clientRev` conflict | somebody edited in the browser meanwhile | Re-read with `get_section_json` and re-apply. Never retry with a stale rev. |
| A named tool does not exist on the server | server older or newer than this skill | Say so plainly. Never substitute a tool that merely sounds similar. |
| An edit is reported but a read does not show it | it did not land | Report the failure. Never claim a write you did not verify by reading it back. |
