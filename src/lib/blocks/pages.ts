// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Composed pages: rendering a page SnabbSajt knows about, with the agency's own
// components.
//
// Plan: the app's P0-2026-08-19 master plan, slice 1.3, owner answer 12 — "let
// users delete, edit and add pages, and build using blocks, that are added to
// the agency's version if they pull. Make it work."
//
// This is the resolver half of that, framework-free on purpose so the Next.js
// glue (`<SnabbSajtPages>`) stays a thin file a developer can read in a minute
// and replace if their routing is unusual.
//
// Three rules, and each one is a thing an agency would otherwise discover the
// hard way in front of a client:
//
//  1. **Their own routes win.** A page SnabbSajt knows about is served only
//     where the app has no route of its own, because a catch-all that shadowed
//     `/kontakt` would replace a hand-built page with a content-managed one on
//     the day somebody typed that slug into the editor.
//  2. **An unknown block renders NOTHING, and says so.** Not a placeholder, not
//     an error boundary: a live page must never grow a grey box because a
//     deploy went out before the component did. `onMissingBlock` is how a build
//     log gets to complain while the visitor sees a page.
//  3. **The props are passed through as data.** No merging with defaults, no
//     coercion. The client's content is what the client wrote, and a component
//     that wants a fallback writes one in the component.
