 * behind it. The commit path is strict on purpose (`%PDF-` magic, size cap,

 * the visitor cannot open is worse than one we never claimed to have.
 *
 * `before` is the pre-remap content, and it is what tells those two cases
 * apart: an item that never had a `document` is the owner's own placeholder
 * and is left exactly where they put it. Without it, exporting a site with an
 * unfilled document row and importing it back would silently delete the row.
 * Omit `before` and the check is skipped rather than guessed at.
