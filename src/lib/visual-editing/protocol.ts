// Visual-editing bridge — the wire protocol between the SnabbSajt editor and a
// headless site rendering inside its canvas.
//
// The shape of the problem: the builder's site runs THEIR code, so it cannot
// run inside our renderer, and we will not execute it. Instead their site runs
// where it always runs — on their own host — and the editor embeds it in a
// sandboxed iframe. Content flows in, click-to-edit intents flow back.
//
// Two rules make this safe, and both are enforced on both sides:
//
//   1. EVERY message is checked against an expected origin. A page inside the
//      iframe can navigate itself anywhere; without this check a third-party
//      page could impersonate the site and receive draft content.
//   2. Nothing executable ever crosses. The payload is a SiteSnapshot — the
//      same validated, typed document the published site renders — plus flat
//      identifiers. No HTML, no functions, no style strings.
//
// The editor is the source of truth for content. The site is the source of
// truth for layout and for where a field appears on screen. Neither trusts the
// other for anything outside its own half.
