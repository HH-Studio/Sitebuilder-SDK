# Convert an existing website to a SnabbSajt Site Kit package

```
prompt-version: 1.1.0
requires-cli: ">=0.3.0"        # snabbsajt --version must satisfy this
portable-format: sajt-site@1
report-contract: snabbsajt-import-report@1
```

Paste everything below this line into your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor,
Codex). Replace `<SOURCE>` with the site to convert: a Next.js/React repo path,
an HTML file or static zip, or a public URL.

You are converting an existing website (`<SOURCE>`) into a validated SnabbSajt
site package. The deliverable is **data, not code**: a `PortableSiteV1`
`site.json` plus asset blobs, packed into a bundle zip that a human imports
into SnabbSajt. Nothing you produce executes on the customer site.

## 0. Preflight — fail loudly, do not improvise

1. Run `snabbsajt --version` (or `npx @snabbsajt/cli --version`).
   - Command missing → STOP and tell the human:
     `npm install -g @snabbsajt/cli` (or prefix every command with
     `npx @snabbsajt/cli`).
   - Version below the `requires-cli` floor in this prompt's header → STOP and
     tell the human to upgrade. Do not proceed with an older CLI; its
     validator does not match this prompt.
2. Run `snabbsajt site doctor --json`. Stop on any reported incompatibility.
3. Confirm `snabbsajt site validate` exists (`snabbsajt site validate --help`
   exits 0). If it does not, this prompt is stale for your CLI — stop.

No API key is needed. Every command below runs locally; none uploads or
publishes anything.

## 1. Safety contract (non-negotiable)

- Never run the source site or execute its React, JavaScript, PHP, plugins,
  build tools, or arbitrary CSS. Source code is **evidence to read**, never a
  runtime.
- Never install the source's dependencies or load its env vars.
- Never invent business facts: no made-up prices, opening hours, phone
  numbers, addresses, testimonials, claims, or legal text. A fact you cannot
  cite from the source stays out and becomes a review item.
- Deterministic source evidence beats your inference. When the rendered HTML
  or repo content says one thing and your guess says another, the source wins.
- Unsupported features are **skipped and reported with a reason**, never
  smuggled in as raw HTML or fake sections. Raw HTML, custom components,
  scripts, iframes and tracking snippets are not expressible in the format.

## 2. Inventory the source

Read, do not execute. Build a written inventory of:

- pages and navigation structure (which routes carry real content);
- all copy, in the customer's own words (fix typos only);
- business facts with their source location: name, phone, email, address,
  opening hours, socials, services, prices;
- images actually used (collect each once; note real pixel dimensions and
  write alt text from context);
- design signals: rough palette, typography feel, layout patterns;
- behavior: forms, booking widgets, analytics, animations, embeds — these map
  to native SnabbSajt settings/sections or get skipped, never executed.

For a Next.js repo read `app/`/`pages/` routes and components as content. For
a live URL or HTML zip, prefer the deterministic importer as your baseline:
`snabbsajt site import html <url|file|zip> -o ./candidate --json` — then
improve its output instead of starting from scratch. For WordPress use
`snabbsajt site import wordpress --url <url> --wxr <export.xml> --out ./candidate`.

## 3. Map to typed sections — enumerate, never recall

The section registry is the only vocabulary. **Enumerate it from the installed
package; do not trust your memory of type or variant names:**

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
const m = await import('@snabbsajt/site-kit');
for (const t of m.SECTION_TYPES)
  console.log(t, '::', m.SECTION_REGISTRY[t].variants.map(v => v.key).join(' '));
"
```

(In the SDK repo itself, `contract/portable-v1.json` is the same truth as a
JSON schema.) Each `SECTION_REGISTRY` entry also carries `whenToUse` — read it
when unsure which type fits. Use a type only when the region truly is that kind
of content. If no type fits, skip with a reason and note it as a candidate for
a new generic variant; do not contort content to fake a layout. This package is
a redesign on SnabbSajt blocks and will not look like the source site. Say so
in chat and in the report, and set `provenance.sourceUrl` in `site.json` when
the source has an address. If the human wants the same look, stop: their own
Next.js/React repo goes through `snabbsajt init --agency` (the
`make-site-editable` skill), and a live URL or static export goes into the app
as an exact copy ("Move your website" / Settings > Backup & move).

Package rules that bite:

- Home page has `slug: ""`. Fold thin source pages into sections of a richer
  page and record the merge.
- Give every page and section a stable `externalKey` (e.g. `home`,
  `home/hero`) so a later re-import can merge instead of duplicating.
- Omit `sections[].order` — the importer orders by array position.
- Asset refs are export-local strings you invent (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`); blobs go
  in `assets/<exportId>.<ext>`, and `assets[].url` uses the
  `bundle://<exportId>` placeholder. Record real width/height — the importer
  re-decodes and rejects mismatches.
- Theme: pick palette/fontPair tokens, or use `theme.customPalette` +
  `customBrandHex` for the customer's real brand. Never paste raw hex into
  section content.

## 4. Build → validate → iterate

Author `site.json` (or typed `defineSite()` in TypeScript), then loop until
clean:

```bash
snabbsajt site validate ./candidate --json
snabbsajt site inspect  ./candidate --json   # compare counts to your inventory
```

Validation errors block; fix them at the reported path. Warnings are
advisory — resolve or explain each in the report. Then pack:

```bash
snabbsajt site pack ./candidate -o site-bundle.zip
```

## 5. Conversion report (required, exact buckets)

Produce `conversion-report.md` next to the bundle. Every source element lands
in exactly one bucket — this is the `snabbsajt-import-report@1` contract:

1. **Imported exactly** — content carried over verbatim.
2. **Converted** — mapped to a named SnabbSajt feature (say which).
3. **Merged / reorganized** — source pages or blocks folded together, and how.
4. **Skipped, with reason** — every unsupported feature, named, with why.
5. **Missing source evidence** — facts the site implies but never states.
6. **AI-proposed** — anything you authored beyond the source, each with the
   evidence it rests on and a confidence.
7. **Assets/scripts that failed safety checks** — e.g. active-content SVGs.
8. **Redirects proposed** — old URL → new slug.
9. **Manual actions required before publish** — the human's checklist.

A report with unresolved blocking items describes a **review draft**, never a
finished site. Do not use the words "complete" or "publish-ready" unless every
bucket 4–9 entry is resolved or explicitly accepted by the human.

## 6. Stop. Show the human. Do not import.

Your job ends with the validated `site-bundle.zip` and the conversion report.
Print the report and wait. The human reviews it, then imports the zip
themselves in SnabbSajt (Settings → Backup & move, or /dashboard/import) — the
import creates an unpublished draft and never overwrites or publishes
anything. Do not upload, import, or publish on their behalf, and do not claim
any step succeeded that you did not run and verify.

**Exception — the human explicitly asks you to upload.** With CLI ≥ 0.4.0 and
a `SNABBSAJT_ADMIN_TOKEN` (`snabbsajt admin pair`), you may run
`snabbsajt push ./candidate --site <id> --dry-run`, show the merge report
(added / updated / unchanged / conflicts), and only after the human approves
that report run the same command without `--dry-run`. Never push to a site the
human did not name, and never publish.

## Per-agent wrappers

The prompt body above is identical for every agent. Real differences only:

**Claude Code** — paste as-is, or install the richer packaged skill:
`snabbsajt skills install --agent claude` (local, no API key). Claude Code can
run every command itself; let it.

**Cursor** — paste into chat (or save as a project rule). Cursor may ask
before each terminal command; approve the `snabbsajt site *` commands — they
are local and read-only toward the network.

**Codex** — paste as-is, or `snabbsajt skills install --agent codex`. In
sandboxed modes, fetching a live URL in step 2 may need network approval; the
validate/pack loop needs none.
