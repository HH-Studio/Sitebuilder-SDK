// Device-code pairing for the `admin` namespace — `POST /v1/cli/pair/{start,poll}`.
//
// The same shape as `snabbsajt connect`, deliberately a different endpoint pair
// and a different credential. `connect` mints a read-only, single-site delivery
// token; this mints a CAPABILITY-SCOPED token that can also write, and the owner
// approves it scope by scope in a browser they are already signed in to.
//
// Two consequences the caller must respect:
//   • `start` answers with the NORMALISED scope set, not the one we asked for
//     (an unknown scope string is dropped, `site:read` is always added). Print
//     the server's set, never the request.
//   • `poll` answers with the GRANTED set, which the owner may narrow further by
//     unticking a scope on the approval page. Print that too — a developer who
//     thinks they hold `publish` and does not will otherwise read the resulting
//     denial as a bug.
